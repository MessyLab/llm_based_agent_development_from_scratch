# LLM based Agent From Scratch

## About

Python implementations of some of the fundamental LLM based Agent method from scratch, like CoT, ReAct, etc.

The purpose of this project is to understand the core methods of agent development using Python, without relying on frameworks like Langchain.

## Table of Contents

Currently, we are only these four methods: CoT, Self-refine, Plan and Execute, and ReAct.

## Use

Currently, we're only using OpenAI as the LLM, so everyone needs their own API key. Additionally, the project is implemented using JupyterLab, so you'll need to have a JupyterLab environment set up.
